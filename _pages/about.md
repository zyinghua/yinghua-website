I'm a Bachelor of Computer Science graduate from Monash University. My current study interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, I have learned fundamental machine learning techniques, natural language processing as well as deep learning. Looking forward to enjoying hands-on research experience in Computer Vision/NLP/Machine Learning!

I'm planning to undertake Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science at The University of Sydney for the whole next year.
