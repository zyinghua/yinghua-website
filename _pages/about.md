I'm a Bachelor of Computer Science graduate from Monash University.
My current study interest lies in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing or broadly Artificial Intelligence.

I'm currently doing Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science at The University of Sydney with a 
research focus on the image generation field.

I believe "Technology is about turning something magical into reality"!
