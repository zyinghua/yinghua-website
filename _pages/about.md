I'm a Bachelor of Computer Science graduate from Monash University. My current study interest lies in Deep Learning & Computer Vision, or broadly Artificial Intelligence; I have acquired knowledge of fundamental Machine Learning techniques, Natural Language Processing as well as several Deep Learning insights. Looking forward to enjoying relevant hands-on research!

I'm currently doing Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science at The University of Sydney with a focus on deep learning.

I believe "Technology is about turning something magical into reality"!
