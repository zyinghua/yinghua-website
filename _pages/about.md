Hi! I'm an AI enthusiast who received a Bachelor of Computer Science and an Honours degree from Monash University and the University of Sydney, respectively.

My current study and research interests lie in Generative Models, or broadly, Artificial Intelligence. 

I believe that "technology is about turning something magical into reality"!
