I'm a Bachelor of Computer Science graduate from Monash University, and a graduate of Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science from The University of Sydney, where I conducted research in the field of image generation.

My current study interests lie in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Generative Models, or broadly Artificial Intelligence. 

I believe that "technology is about turning something magical into reality"!
